- Use Drizzle schema definition (pgTable/mysqlTable/sqliteTable) - never write Prisma-style schema files
- Use $inferSelect and $inferInsert for type inference - never manually define types that mirror DB schemas
- Use the Drizzle query builder API - never use raw SQL strings unless absolutely necessary
- Use drizzle-kit for migrations - never write migration SQL manually
- Use prepared statements for queries that run frequently
